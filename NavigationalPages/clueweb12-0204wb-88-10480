		<h3>Court Summary<br>
		<span class="date">February 26, 1999</span></h3>
		<p>The defense led the first witness on Friday morning, Dr. Victor Kalnberzs. He   is a surgeon with more than 50 years of experience. He was born in Moscow and   now lives in Riga, Latvia. He remains an active member of the Russia Academy of   Medical Sciences. He served in the Afghanistan war, receiving a prestigious   medal from Gromyko for his medical services. His experience includes trauma   medicine.</p>
<p>He explained that the doctor who first performed blood transfusions in Russia   proved this treatment was dangerous. This doctor died from a blood transfusion.   Dr. Kalnberzs stated that in his experience he had seen more persons die from   blood transfusions than from refusal of blood transfusions. He described the   complications included heptatitis, AIDS and new viruses that continue to appear.   He encouraged use of alternatives to avoid reliance on blood therapy. He   referred to the cell-saver, quick action to stop the bleeding and blood   substitutes. These were all available in Moscow. When asked whether blood   substitutes are expensive luxuries unavailable in Russia, he highlighted the   Russian blood substitute, Perftoran. He stated that this was a blood alternative   that Russia could be proud of and should be a profitable export to the West.</p>
<p>The judge asked about the position of Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses in relation to the   prosecutor&#8217;s claim that they encouraged suicide or refusal of medical   assistance. He disagreed with the prosecutor. He had many patients that were   Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses. He explained that they do not refuse medical treatment, but   choose treatment by way of alternatives. He added that the patient has the right   to decide, not the doctor. This was a sacred right, based on medical ethics,   human rights, and the law. He showed Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses were not unique. He   cited examples such as patients who may refuse an organ transplant. </p>
<p>Dr. Kalnberzs then quoted a statement from one of Russia&#8217;s leading   hematologists, Dr. Vorobyov:</p>
<p>&#8220;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the position of Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses, who agree to any medical   intervention.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in place of donor blood and its primary components.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. cannot be   interpreted as refusal of medical assistance as a whole, much less suicide, and   this position in general is not in conflict with modern scientific   achievement.&#8221;</p>
<p>The prosecution called its next witness, S.A. Ivanova. She began by telling   the story of her son, now 28 years of age. She claimed that he had a normal   upbringing until he began associating with Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses. She alleged that   excessive preaching, meetings and Bible study led to mental problems.   Eventually, it became so serious he was confined to a hospital. After treatment,   he left and she arranged for his baptism in the Russian Orthodox Church. As she   talked, the judge asked her secretary to bring out a file. It contained   documents from the hospital where her son had been treated. The judge stopped   the witness and read from the medical file. It told an entirely different story.   It showed that her son had severe mental problems from childhood. The treating   doctors concluded that there was no direct relationship between the mental   illness and her son&#8217;s association with Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses. </p>
<p>Ivanova also participated in the Committee for Rescuing Youth From   Totalitarian Sects. &#8216;What does this Committee do?&#8217; asked the judge. Ivanova   responded, &#8216;I don&#8217;t know.&#8217;</p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s final witness was Y.G. Bakayev. The prosecutor in his complaint   claimed that Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses had caused his divorce. However, during   Bakayev&#8217;s testimony, it was revealed that he and his wife are still married to   this day. They had lived together for 12 years. She was one of Jehovah&#8217;s   Witnesses. They had one son. His complaints were similar to previous prosecution   witnesses. Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses don&#8217;t celebrate traditional holidays, birthdays,   and engage in preaching. He claimed that his wife&#8217;s religion is &#8220;a waste of   time&#8221;, and therefore is bad for his son. When confronted with a signed statement   from his son stating life with father &#8220;is impossible&#8221;, Bakayev stated &#8220;I have a   right to punish my son&#8221;. He admitted that his wife had called the police to   their home several times complaining that he beat her. He explained, &#8220;It&#8217;s never   been proven in court.&#8221; He also admitted that he only paid support to his wife   after being forced by court order. They were now living in the same apartment   because she did not want to risk losing custody by way of divorce proceedings.   Like all other family witnesses for the prosecution, he too participated in the   anti-cult Committee.</p>
<p>The day ended with the judge telling the lawyer for Moscow City Department of   Justice to be prepared to explain her position on Monday, March 1, 1999. Perhaps   on Monday, observers will learn if Moscow wants to ban the religious activity of   Jehovah&#8217;s Witnesses.</p>
