        Yelnats was given a choice. The judge said, &quot;You may go to jail, 
        or you may go to Camp Green Lake.&quot; Stanley was from a poor family. 
        He had never been to camp before. </font></i></font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">And so, Stanley Yelnats 
        seems set to serve an easy sentence, which is only fair because he is 
        as innocent as you or me. But Stanley is not going where he thinks he 
        is. Camp Green Lake is like no other camp anywhere. It is a bizarre, almost 
        otherworldly place that has no lake and nothing that is green. Nor is 
        it a camp, at least not the kind of camp kids look forward to in the summertime. 
        It is a place that once held "the largest lake in Texas," but today it 
        is only a scorching desert wasteland, dotted with countless holes dug 
        by the boys who live at the camp. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The trouble started 
        when Stanley was accused of stealing a pair of shoes donated by basketball 
        great Clyde "Sweetfeet" Livingston to a celebrity auction. In court, the 
        judge doesn't believe Stanley's claim that the shoes fell from the sky 
        onto his head. And yet, that's exactly what happened. Oddly, though, Stanley 
        doesn't blame the judge for falsely convicting him. Instead, he blames 
        the whole misadventure on his "no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing-great-great-grandfather." 
        Thanks to this benighted distant relative, the Yelnats family had been 
        cursed for generations. For Stanley, his current troubles are just a natural 
        part of being a Yelnats.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> At Camp Green Lake, 
        the warden makes the boys "build character" by spending all day, every 
        day, digging holes: five feet wide and five feet deep. It doesn't take 
        long for Stanley to realize there's more than character improvement going 
        on at Camp Green Lake. The boys are digging holes because the treacherous 
        warden is searching for something, and before long Stanley begins his 
        own search&#151;for the truth. </font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Fate conspires to 
        resolve it all&#151;the family curse, the mystery of the holes, the drought 
        that destroyed Green Lake, and also, the legend of Kissing Kate Barlow, 
        an infamous outlaw of the Wild West. The great wheel of justice has ground 
        slowly for generations, but now it is about to reveal its verdict. <a name="Stan"></a></font></p>

        </font> A <i>Holes</i> companion book </font></p>
      <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">"If you're reading this book, 
        chances are you've been convicted of a crime and have been sentenced to 
        the Camp Green Lake Juvenile Correctional Facility.... Maybe you're innocent&#151;more 
        likely not," Stanley Yelnats states in the voice his followers have come 
        to love. </font></p>

        at Camp Green Lake&#151;or somewhere similar&#151;this is the guide for 
        you. Stanley (Caveman, to some of you) offers anecdotes and advice on 
        everything from digging the perfect hole to identifying and avoiding the 
        wildlife (scorpions, tarantulas, rattlesnakes, yellow-spotted lizards, 
        Mr. Sir) to help make your stay a more pleasant one. </font></p>

      <h1 align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#999999">HOLES 
        Q&amp;A</font></h1>
      <p align="left"><b><i><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Holes</font></i><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> 
        seems to be as much about a place as about the characters. Is that your 
        feeling? <br>
        </font></b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> Yes. While every 
        other story I'd written had begun with the characters, to me this story 
        has always been about a place&#151;Camp Green Lake. The story began with 
        the place, and the characters and plot grew out of it. Of course, Camp 
        Green Lake has no lake and hardly anything is green. There once was a 
        very large lake here, the largest lake in Texas. That was over a hundred 
        years ago. Now it is just a dry, flat wasteland. There used to be a town 
        of Greenlake as well. The town also shriveled and dried up. During the 
        summer, the daytime temperature hovers around 95 degrees in the shade, 
        if you can find any shade. There's not much shade in a big, dry lake. 
        The only trees are two old oaks on the Eastern edge of the lake. A hammock 
        is stretched between the two trees, and a log cabin stands behind that. 
        The kids are forbidden to lie in the hammock. It belongs to the warden. 
        The warden owns the shade. When you first start reading the book, however, 
        you don't know it's that kind of camp. You just know that you're going 
        to Camp Greenlake. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Where did 
        you get the idea for <i>Holes</i>? <br>
        </b> No, I didn't live next door to a juvenile correction facility. Actually, 
        I never start with a full idea of what I'm going to write. I usually just 
        start with a piece of a character and then see what develops. In this 
        case, I didn't start with a character; I started writing about Camp Greenlake 
        and it developed from there. I suppose the initial inspiration for writing 
        about the camp came from the heat of summers in Texas. At the time I began 
        the book, we had just returned from the relative coolness of a vacation 
        in Maine to the Texas summer. Anybody who has ever tried to do yard work 
        in Texas in July can easily imagine Hell to be a place where you are required 
        to dig a hole five feet deep and five feet across day after day under 
        the brutal Texas sun. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>How long did 
        it take you to write <i>Holes</i>?<br>
        </b> A year and a half. A book like <i>Marvin Redpost: Is He a Girl?</i> 
        is simply written and relatively short, taking four to six months to finish. 
        In contrast, Holes took a year and a half to complete. I went through 
        five rewrites before sending it to my editor. It occurs to me now that 
        Stanley was sentenced to Camp Green Lake for eighteen months, which was 
        exactly how long it took me to write Holes. I arbitrarily chose the length 
        of his sentence early on. Maybe on some unconscious level, I knew how 
        long it would take. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Did you find 
        the characters taking on a life of their own as you were writing? <br>
        </b> It happens every once in a while when you're writing that certain 
        characters seem to leap off the page and take over the book, and that's 
        what happened with the story of Kate and Sam. I had expected to make Kissin' 
        Kate a complete villain, but when I started writing about her I ended 
        up making her someone else entirely; it surprised me. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Why do you 
        think book's lead character, Stanley Yelnats, connects with so many children? 
        <br>
        </b> Stanley isn't a hero-type. He's a kind of pathetic kid who feels 
        like he has no friends, feels like his life is cursed. And I think everyone 
        can identify with that in one way or another. And then there's the fact 
        that here he is, a kid who isn't a hero, but he lifts himself up and becomes 
        one. I think readers can imagine themselves rising with Stanley. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>What was the 
        hardest part of writing <i>Holes</i>?<br>
        </b> People often ask me how I managed to tie everything together at the 
        end, but that wasn't the hard part. I knew how everything was going to 
        fit together. The hard part was laying out the strands throughout the 
        story, telling the story of Kate Barlow and of Elya Yelnats and Elya's 
        son, without it getting in the way of Stanley's story. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The other problem 
        I had occurred when Stanley was digging his hole for the first time. I 
        wanted the reader to feel what a long, miserable experience this is, digging 
        those 5' by 5' holes. But how many times can you say, "He dug his shovel 
        back into the dirt and lifted out another shovelful?" My solution was 
        to interweave two stories, bringing more variety to the tale. Stanley's 
        anxious first days at Camp Green Lake are set off against the story of 
        his ancestor, Elya Yelnats, whose broken promise to a gypsy results indirectly 
        in young Stanley's bad luck.</font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b><i>Holes</i> 
        is sweet and charming, but it is also darker and scarier than your other 
        books. The warden, for example, mixes rattlesnake venom in her fingernail 
        polish and threatens to scratch Stanley. Was it your intention to write 
        a frightening tale?<br>
        </b> My daughter, Sherre, who was in fourth grade when <i>Holes</i> came 
        out, surprised me when she told me that the warden was scary. I had never 
        really thought of the warden as scary or that the scene as especially 
        disturbing. Rattlesnake venom, well, it's almost cartoonish. It's like 
        a situation from that campy old TV show, Batman. It was never my intention 
        to write a grim story, and I don't think it is. For instance, I came up 
        with the idea of the boys digging holes because I liked the irony, not 
        because it was harsh. While they were ostensibly digging to build character, 
        the camp warden actually had hidden and dishonorable reasons for demanding 
        this chore. I wanted <i>Holes</i> to be fun and adventurous. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>How did you 
        get the idea of rattlesnake venom in the warden's fingernail polish? <br>
        </b> It's hard to remember where different ideas come from, but I think 
        it first started when I originally thought the warden was going to be 
        the granddaughter of Kissing Kate Barlow. And Kissing Kate always killed 
        the men she kissed. At the time, I may have even considered that her lipstick 
        might be poisoned. So, I wanted to do something along the same lines. 
        Instead of poison lipstick, the warden had poison nail polish. But then 
        I ended up liking Kissing Kate Barlow, and liking her character. So, instead 
        I made the warden the granddaughter of Trout Walker. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>How do you 
        decide what is too scary for a child or how far you can go? <br>
        </b> Aside from the rattlesnake venom, there were other scenes in the 
        book where I really did struggle with this issue. There was a scene where 
        Kate Barlow, a notorious outlaw, is being tortured by these two people 
        who have captured her to find out where she buried the treasure. Most 
        of the time, my judgments are based on instinct and experience. I don't, 
        for instance, experiment with kids to find out if I've gone too far. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>The book is 
        very funny, but in an offbeat way. <br>
        </b> Yes. Sometimes when I start reading, people aren't quite sure if 
        this is a humorous book or not, and they're not sure whether to laugh 
        at first, and then gradually, people start laughing. </font></p>
      <p align="left"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Will you write 
        a sequel to <i>Holes</i>? <br>
        </b> I don't expect to. I feel like the story is completely finished. 
        I don't really have more to add to it. </font></p>
